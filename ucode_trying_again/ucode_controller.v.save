//this module loads the machine code for the two instructions that will be sent through
//the stages and send those instructions to the mux as well as a control signal


//this module also has the FSM to determine when to supply the MOV instruction, the ADD instruction, and when to unfreeze PC
//and hand over control to the regular main memory instructions


//example:

//MOV R0, #2
//MUL R1, R0, #3


//FSM psuedocode:


module ucode_controller (immediate, )


  reg [3:0] scratchpad [31:0] //making a couple of local scratchpad


  case (state)
